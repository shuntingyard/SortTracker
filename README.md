# SortTracker
## Intro
Three weeks before checking this in I felt like starting to learn some
JavaScript. Animation for sort algorithms was something I implemented
year ago as a Java applet. So why not redo it in a more modern way,
loading several small chunks of compressed code and some HTML5/ CSS3
instead of having to fetch one big applet running in a Java VM.  
And while rewriting my old stuff as a web app was cool, it was also an
opportunity to try a very simple mobile-first design approach.
## What it does
TBD
