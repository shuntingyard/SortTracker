# SortTracker
## Intro
Three weeks before first checking this in, I felt like starting to learn
some JavaScript. Animating sort algorithms is something I implemented
years ago as a Java applet. So why not redo it in a more modern way,
loading several small chunks of compressed code and some HTML5/ CSS3,
instead of having to fetch one big applet running in a Java VM.
  
And while rewriting my old stuff as a web app was cool, it was also an
opportunity to try a basic mobile-first design approach.
## What it does
Fill an array with more or less (standard normal distribution, nearly reverse ordered etc.) random integers. While sorting the array in memory with a pre-selected algorithm, put instructions to change the array's 2D representation into a queue.
  
Animate the sort process going from (more or less) random order to ascending order by processing the queued instructions.
## Inspirations
For sorting: "Algorithms in Java, Parts 1-4" by Robert Sedgewick

## Trivia
Programming activity was code-named "мравките" (Bulgarian for ants). See why <a href="http://webapp.topmid.com/st/">here</a>.
