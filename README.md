# SortTracker
## Intro
Three weeks before the initial push for this repo, I felt like starting to
learn some JavaScript. Animating sort algorithms is something I implemented
years ago as a Java applet. So why not do it again in a more modern way,
loading several small chunks of compressed code and some HTML5/CSS3,
instead of having to fetch one big applet depending on the Java plug-in.
  
And while rewriting my old stuff as a web app was cool, it was also an
opportunity to try a basic mobile-first design approach.
## What it does
Fill an array with more or less (standard normal distribution,
nearly reverse ordered etc.) random integers. While sorting the array
in memory with a pre-selected algorithm, put instructions to change
the array's 2D representation into a queue.
  
Animate the sort process going from random order to ascending order by
processing the queued instructions.
## Inspirations
For sorting: "Algorithms in Java, Parts 1-4" by Robert Sedgewick

## Trivia
The project was code-named "мравките" (Bulgarian for ants) by a pal of mine.
