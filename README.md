# SortTracker
## Intro
Three weeks before first checking this in, I felt like starting to learn
some JavaScript. Animating sort algorithms is something I implemented
years ago as a Java applet. So why not redo it in a more modern way,
loading several small chunks of compressed code and some HTML5/ CSS3,
instead of having to fetch one big applet running in a Java VM.  
And while rewriting my old stuff as a web app was cool, it was also an
opportunity to try a basic mobile-first design approach.
## What it does
TBD
